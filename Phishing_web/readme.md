# Phishing
Phishing is a type of social engineering used to steal information.

## Phishing_web
This is a basic webpage pretend to be a login page of instagram but whenever a user tries to fill data and submit, 
it generally post the data into the server and the server store it in a database named "heckedData".
I made everything from scratch because trusting a random tool for phishing is foolish 

### Tech Stacks
1. Node JS
2. Mongo DB
3. Express JS
4. HTML
5. CSS
6. Mongoose
7. npm (Node package manager)

### Further steps
I don't want any of you to do any kind of phishing but if you want to make it working
1. Use any port forwarding tool (like ngrok.) or aws server to run it globally
2. Then use any temporary mailing system to stay anonymous or fake the email
